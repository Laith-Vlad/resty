Form Component

The Form component is responsible for taking user input and making HTTP requests to APIs. It allows users to specify the request method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), the URL, and an optional request body.
Results Component

The Results component displays the responses from the API requests. It shows the data received from the API, and if the data is too large, it provides pagination options to navigate through the results.
